# 🧠 DocuMind Enterprise

**AI-Powered Enterprise Knowledge Assistant**

DocuMind Enterprise is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based corporate knowledge assistant. Upload company documents (PDFs) and instantly get accurate, AI-generated answers — grounded strictly in the document content. Built as an internship project at **Infotact Solutions**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **PDF Upload** — Upload any company document (handbooks, SOPs, policies, project docs)
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** — Finds relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Answers** — Uses Groq's Llama 3.3 70B model to generate accurate, context-grounded answers
- 🧠 **Context-Aware RAG** — Combines vector retrieval with LLM generation for precise responses
- 🔒 **Grounded Responses** — If information isn't in the document, the system says "I don't know" instead of hallucinating
- ⚡ **Async Backend** — FastAPI with background task processing and async file I/O
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** — Documents remain indexed across sessions using ChromaDB
- 🗑️ **Cache Management** — Automatic cache invalidation on new uploads

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devvaish21/documind.git
cd documind
```

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your API keys
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Open **two terminals** from the project root:

**Terminal 1 — Start the backend:**
```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

**Terminal 2 — Start the frontend:**
```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

Open your browser at:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Upload a PDF document using the sidebar
2. Wait for **"PDF Indexed Successfully"** confirmation
3. Type your question in the chat box
4. Get an instant, AI-generated answer based on the document content

### Example Questions
- "Can you list down how many projects are there?"
- "What is StatBot Pro?"
- "What is the refund policy?"
- "Summarize the onboarding process"

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/upload` | Upload a document (PDF) |
| `POST` | `/ask` | Ask a question against uploaded documents |
| `GET` | `/documents` | List all uploaded documents |
| `DELETE` | `/documents/{id}` | Delete a document |
| `POST` | `/clear-cache` | Clear the vector store cache |

### Example: Ask a Question

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the onboarding process for new employees?"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "According to the onboarding SOP, new employees should...",
  "sources": ["onboarding_sop_v2.pdf"]
}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Generic/broad queries (e.g., "summarize the PDF") may occasionally return "I don't know" if relevant chunks aren't in the top-k retrieval — a known characteristic of vector similarity search
- First-time PDF upload may take longer due to embedding model initialization

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Multi-language document support
- Voice input for queries
- Multi-document comparison
- Cloud deployment (Render + Streamlit Cloud)
- Slack & Microsoft Teams integration
- User authentication & rate limiting
- Streaming responses
